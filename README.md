## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to put an image as a background
```html
<div class="image">
  &nbsp;
</div>
```

Also learned this sequence of attributes to adapted an image inside a background 
```css
.image {
    width: 300px;
    height: 450px;
    background-image: url('../images/image-product-desktop.jpg');
    background-size: contain;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

I learned to use the 'overflow' attribute to adapt the images to a specific measurement of a background
```css
overflow: hidden;
```

And i learned this attribute to calc any math operation
```css
width: calc(300px - 31.5px - 31.5px);
```
